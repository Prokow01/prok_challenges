Scratch Pad - State Server

Basic Requirements:

	[] create RESTful server w/ Flask
		[] Map RESTful endpoints correctly
	[x] ingest state boundaries
		[x] In-Memory Dict
			[x] no EndOfLine delimiters
		[] SQLite
	[] Unit Tests
		[] Doctest
		[] Py Unit Tests


Optimization:
	[] Pool - This problem isn't necessarily hard, let's leverage a multiprocessing approach, there will only ever need be 50 processes running at any time (a small amount for modern hardware)
	[] Map/Filter/Reduce - this is explicitly called out in job description, worth digging into
		(http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html)

Mapping Problem:
	[] Figure out how to get within state boundaries
		[] generate every point within every state boundary... might be a little much but once initialized it's lighting fast - experimental approach

Nice to Haves:
	[] Config file to change approaches and measure differences
	[] Start/Kill Script
	[] Makefile?? never made one before, but never too late to start!
	[] add setup.py to get everything running from scratch
		[] Flask
		[] pymatgen - python coords
		[] SQLite
		[] SQLite ingestion script - post install
